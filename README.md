# BG-ML-learning
Repository for Jupyter notebooks as part of BG ML learning day.
Initially covering these topics:
- Clustering
- Random Forests

Instructions for running jupyter notebooks:
1. Pull these notebooks from this repo to your working directory
  (Or simply copy from /scratch/cbarth/BG_ML if unfamiliar with git)
2. From working directory run in terminal:
> module load scitools
> jupyter notebook Random_Forest_Tutorial.ipynb
  (if asked for password credentials, use your normal Windows username/password)

This should load up a Firefox page with the Jupyter notebook.

Work through the notebook by running the cells of code. (A shortcut to run a cell is to click on it and press 'Shift+Enter')

Have a play with changing hyperparameters etc. to see what difference they make. You can rerun any cell to overwrite previously saved data.
